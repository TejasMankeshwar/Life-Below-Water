- Life-Below-Water

Welcome to Life-Below-Water, the website that will make you go from a landlubber to a salty sea dog in no time! We, Tejas Mankeshwar, Prajakta Gunjal and Atharv Ayachit, created this website as a part of Google's solution challenge  to raise awareness about the importance of conserving marine life which is the 14th goal of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations.

Our website not only provides information about endangered marine species and the threats they face but also gives users an opportunity to take action and contribute towards the conservation efforts. We believe that it's not enough to simply know about the issues, but it's equally important to take action and make a difference.
Now, we know marine life conservation may not sound like the sexiest topic but bear with us because we've got a few surprises in store!


- Features:

First things first, weave a quiz! And not just any quiz, but a fun and interactive quiz that will make you feel like a marine biologist in training. With various levels of difficulty, from "Nemo Who?" to "Marine Mastermind," our quiz will test your knowledge and make you feel like you're having a good time while learning. Plus, we won't tell anyone if you Google the answers ;)

But wait, there's more! We also provide information about endangered marine species and their habitats, complete with stunning photos that will make you go "wow" and "aww." We want you to know all about the amazing creatures that call the ocean their home and why they need our help to survive.

And now, drum roll please, our pièce de résistance: a clickable text and a button that will take you to an active NGO where you can donate or volunteer for drives. That's right, you can be a real-life superhero for marine life! And if you're feeling generous, you can donate as much as you want, but we won't judge you if you can only spare a few clams ;)


- Conclusion:

At Life-Below-Water, we believe that marine life conservation is no joke, but that doesn't mean we can't have a good time while doing something good for the planet. We hope that our website has entertained you as much as it has informed you and that you're now ready to join us in our mission to save marine life.

So, come aboard our virtual boat, and let's set sail towards a better, more sustainable future for all marine creatures, big and small. Don't forget to wear your life vest (just kidding, you're safe on land), and thank you for visiting Life-Below-Water!
