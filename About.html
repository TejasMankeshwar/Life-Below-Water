    <h1 style="color: #002146;">About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Life-Below-Water, a website created by Tejas Mankeshwar, Prajakta Gunjal, and Atharv Ayachit - three passionate first-year CSE students who have come together to make a positive impact on the environment.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to raise awareness about the importance of marine life conservation and to inspire action to protect our oceans. We believe that small changes can make a big difference, and we hope to empower our visitors to take action towards creating a sustainable future.</p>

    <p>Our website provides a platform for individuals to learn about marine conservation efforts, get involved in community initiatives, and stay informed on the latest developments in the field. We also offer a variety of resources and tools to help our visitors understand the impact of their actions on the ocean and ways they can reduce their carbon footprint.</p>

    <p>We encourage our visitors to research and support NGOs that align with their values and missions. By supporting these organizations, we can all play a part in protecting the delicate balance of marine life and their ecosystems.</p>

    <p>Through Life Below Water, we aim to create a community of like-minded individuals who are committed to making a positive impact on the environment. Join us on our journey towards a more sustainable future, and together, let's protect the beauty and diversity of marine life for generations to come.</p>
