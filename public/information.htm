  <div class="right-text">
     <p>Cape penguins, with their charming tuxedo-like plumage and comical waddle, are a beloved species of penguin that are native to the wild and windswept coastlines of southwestern Africa. Cape penguins are incredibly social animals that live in large colonies, and they use a variety of vocalizations and body language to communicate with one another. They are also known for their unique braying call, which is often described as sounding like a donkey or a donkey-like laugh.Unfortunately, these captivating creatures are now listed as endangered due to a multitude of threats to their survival. From habitat destruction and overfishing to pollution and oil spills, these brave birds are facing a tough fight for survival. However, there is hope! Dedicated conservationists are working tirelessly to protect and restore their natural habitats, and to rehabilitate injured and sick penguins back to full health. With our help and support, we can ensure that future generations will continue to marvel at the antics of these remarkable birds.</p>

  <div class="left-text">
     <p>Corals are some of the most vibrant and mesmerizing creatures on Earth, and they play a critical role in maintaining the health and biodiversity of our planet's oceans. However, these beautiful organisms are now facing a grave threat. Climate change, overfishing, pollution, and ocean acidification are all contributing to the rapid decline of coral reefs around the world. As corals struggle to adapt to these changing conditions, they become more vulnerable to disease, bleaching, and other stressors. This has led to a sharp decline in the number of healthy coral reefs, which is having devastating consequences for countless marine species that depend on them for food and shelter. Urgent action is needed to protect and restore coral reefs before it's too late. By taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint and protect the health of our oceans, we can help to ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy the beauty and diversity of these precious ecosystems.</p>

     <p>The green turtle is a remarkable creature that has been swimming in our oceans for over 100 million years. These graceful reptiles, known for their greenish-brown shells, can weigh up to 700 pounds and travel thousands of miles across the ocean to nest on sandy beaches. Sadly, despite their incredible resilience, green turtles are listed as endangered due to a variety of threats.</p>

     <p>One of the biggest threats facing green turtles is habitat loss. Coastal development, pollution, and climate change are all factors that contribute to the degradation of their nesting beaches and feeding grounds. Additionally, hunting, poaching, and accidental entanglement in fishing gear all pose significant risks to their survival.</p>

     <p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protect green turtles and their habitat. </p>

  <div class="left-text">
     <p>The vaquita, also known as the "panda of the sea," is one of the world's smallest and rarest marine mammals. These adorable creatures, found only in the Gulf of California, Mexico, are known for their dark rings around their eyes and lips, which make them look like they are wearing makeup. Sadly, vaquitas are critically endangered, with only an estimated 10 individuals remaining in the wild.</p>

     <p>The biggest threat to vaquitas is accidental entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets used to catch another endangered species, the totoaba fish. The totoaba's swim bladder is a prized delicacy in China, and the high demand for it has led to an illegal trade, making totoaba fishing and vaquita bycatch even more prevalent. The Mexican government and conservation organizations are working to protect the vaquita and its habitat, but urgent action is needed to prevent this species from disappearing forever.</p>

     <p>Whale sharks are the largest fish species in the world, and they can grow up to 40 feet long and weigh over 20 tons. These gentle giants are awe-inspiring creatures that have captured the hearts of many marine enthusiasts. One of the most fascinating things about whale sharks is their feeding behavior. They feed by filtering large volumes of seawater through their wide mouths, trapping plankton and small fish in their gills. <br>
      <br>

      Unfortunately, despite their enormous size and wide distribution across the world's oceans, whale sharks are classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The primary reason for their endangered status is overfishing. Whale sharks are often caught as bycatch in commercial fishing operations or directly targeted for their meat, fins, and oil. Additionally, their habitat is threatened by pollution, climate change, and coastal development. <br> <br>
    
      To protect these magnificent creatures, conservation efforts are essential. Scientists are using satellite tags to track their movements and better understand their behavior and migration patterns. Fishing regulations have been implemented to reduce the number of whale sharks caught unintentionally.</p>
